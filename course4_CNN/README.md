## Course Overview

### Week 1: Foundations of CNNs

In this first module, you'll get your hands dirty by implementing the core building blocks of a CNN from scratch in **NumPy**. You'll explore the concepts of convolution, padding, and stride, and learn how pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of your data. The assignment will challenge you to write your own forward and backward propagation for these layers, giving you a deep, intuitive understanding of how they work.

### Week 2: Deep Convolutional Models

Now that you've mastered the fundamentals, you'll transition to using a professional deep learning framework like **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. You'll study and build classic and modern CNN architectures, and you'll learn about **transfer learning**, a powerful technique that allows you to leverage knowledge from pre-trained models. This is a crucial skill for tackling complex image classification tasks efficiently.

### Week 3: Object Detection

This week focuses on **object detection**, a more advanced computer vision task that involves not only classifying an object but also locating it within an image using a bounding box. You'll learn the theory behind state-of-the-art algorithms and implement a simplified version of **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**. This assignment is a fantastic opportunity to build a system that can detect multiple objects in a single image.

### Week 4: Special Applications - Face Recognition & Neural Style Transfer

The final module explores two captivating and practical applications of CNNs. You'll learn how to build a **facial recognition system** using the **FaceNet** model, which can verify and identify faces with high accuracy. Additionally, you'll dive into the creative world of **neural style transfer**, where a CNN is used to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another. üé® This assignment is a fun way to conclude the course by creating some truly unique art.
