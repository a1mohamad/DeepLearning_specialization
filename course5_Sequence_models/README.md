# Course 5: Sequence Models 

This course, the final installment of the Deep Learning Specialization, delves into the powerful world of **sequence models**. You'll learn to build and apply models that can process ordered data, such as text and audio, which have revolutionized fields like natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine translation.

### Key Topics Covered

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Understand the fundamental architecture of RNNs and why they are uniquely suited for sequential data. You'll also learn about their variants, including:
    * **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: A simplified version of LSTMs that helps solve the vanishing gradient problem.
    * **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A more complex and powerful RNN variant that excels at learning long-range dependencies in sequences.
    * `Bidirectional RNNs` and `Deep RNNs` to enhance model performance.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Explore foundational concepts in NLP, including language modeling and sentiment analysis. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to:
    * **Word Embeddings**: Learn how to represent words as dense vectors, capturing semantic relationships. You'll work with popular embedding models like `Word2Vec` and `GloVe`.
* **Sequence Models and Attention Mechanism**: Build advanced sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation. This section introduces a crucial concept in modern NLP:
    * **Attention Models**: Learn how attention allows models to weigh different parts of an input sequence, improving performance on long and complex sequences.
* **Applications and Case Studies**: Apply your knowledge to a variety of exciting real-world problems. The course includes hands-on projects for:
    * **Music Generation** 
    * **Dinosaur Name Generation**
    * **Neural Machine Translation**
    * **Trigger Word Detection**
    * **Question Answering**
    * **Named Entity Recognition**

By the end of this course, you'll be able to build and train sophisticated sequence models and understand the key concepts that power cutting-edge applications in AI.
